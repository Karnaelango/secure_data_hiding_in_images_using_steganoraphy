I have created an encrypted image by using steganography

the secret code: This is Karna code we want to lock
the passkey is 123456 for this project

Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography
Here’s a revised version that doesn’t sound like AI:


Project Overview

This project showcases a technique known as image-based steganography, which involves embedding a secret message within an image at the pixel level. The message is hidden in a way that it can only be retrieved later by using a valid passkey for decryption.

 Features

- Embed secret messages within an image**  
- Encrypt the message by altering pixel values**  
- Decrypt the message only with the correct passkey**  
- Uses OpenCV for image manipulation**  

 Project Structure


Secure_Data_Hiding_In_Images_Using_Steganography  
│──  secure_data_hiding.py # Main script  
│── Image.jpg            # Original image (used for encoding)  
│── encryptedImage.jpg   # Encrypted image (output)  
│──  README.md           # Documentation  


Installation & Setup

 1️ Prerequisites

- Python version 3.7 or higher  
- Install OpenCV via pip:  
  
  pip install opencv-python
  

2️ Running the Script

1. Place the image you want to use for encoding (Image.jpg) in the project folder.  
2. Open a terminal and execute:  
   
   python secure_data_hiding.py
   
3. Follow the prompts to input your secret message and passkey.  
4. The script will create an encrypted image called `encryptedImage.jpg` with the hidden message.  
5. To decrypt the message, run the script again and enter the correct passkey.

 How It Works

Encoding:

- The script loads an image using OpenCV.  
- Each character in the secret message is converted into pixel values.  
- Pixels are then altered in a random sequence to embed the message.

Decoding:

- If the correct passkey is provided, the script reads the altered pixel values and reconstructs the original message.

 Limitations

- Best results with uncompressed image formats like .png or .bmp.  
- JPEG images may cause pixel distortions due to compression, making decryption unreliable.  
- The size of the message is limited by the size of the image.

 Example Usage

Encryption


Enter secret code to unlock: hello123
Enter passkey: secret12
The message has been successfully hidden inside encryptedImage.jpg.


Decryption


Enter passkey for decryption: secret12
Decrypted message: hello123
Message retrieved successfully!


 Security Considerations

- The current encryption is basic and does not employ advanced cryptographic techniques.
- For improved security, you could encrypt the message with AES before embedding it into the image.



This version should read more naturally and feel more human-like. Let me know if you need any other changes!
